        text: 'Weaning can be stressful for both calves and producers. A good diet can help, supporting the calves’ growth and productivity throughout the feeding period. Importantly, such a diet can also guard against illness and bacterial infection, both of which can gain a toehold at this transitional time.'

        text: 'Respiratory disease is the most common ailment during the weaning period. For example, a calf is most susceptible to bovine respiratory disease (BRD) during its first four weeks post-weaning. BRD costs the beef industry over $1 billion annually, and prevention is key in reducing treatment costs and preventing performance losses.'

        type: text
        text: 'Since an animal’s digestive tract contains approximately 70% of its entire immune system, rumen development and gut health should be at the top of the list when weaning and receiving calves and getting them started on feed.'

        type: text
        text: 'Gut health refers to an animal’s ability to efficiently absorb and utilize nutrients and to keep harmful microbes and pathogens contained. If the lining, or barrier, of the digestive tract is weak, these microbes and pathogens can escape into the rest of the body, causing numerous diseases, including BRD.'

        type: text
        text: 'Because cattle stressors — not only weaning itself, but transportation, commingling, changes in diet, and diet restriction — can harm the gut lining, continuous support for gut health is essential. Feeding strategies that focus on this are vital to increasing performance and reducing treatment costs, leading to more profitable production.'

        type: text
        text: 'Many good articles and blogs are available to provide tips for successfully weaning calves and adapting them to feed. A good rule of thumb is that calves should be consuming 2.5% to 3% (on a 100% dry matter basis) of their body weight within the first 30 days post weaning. Gradual increases in feed quantity, along with gradual diet or ingredient changes, will aid in the proper adaptation of rumen microflora, improving gut health.'

        text: 'However, feed quantity is only part of the puzzle. Microbes within the digestive tract have vitamin and mineral requirements for proper function and nutrient digestion. Supplementing these in the weaning ration is crucial to gut health, not only supporting nutrient uptake overall but enhancing immunity and improving response to vaccines and treatments.'

        text: 'Vitamin and mineral supplements vary widely and should be chosen carefully for maximum benefit. For example, organic trace minerals are considerably more bioavailable to calves during weaning, which aids in nutrient absorption, bolsters gut health, and reduces harmful excretions of excess minerals into the environment.'

Research shows that prebiotics enhance rumen fermentation, improve digestion, aid in nutrient absorption, and contribute to immune system development.'
