        text: 'In the foothills of the Orlické Mountains near the Polish border lies the town of Žamberk, home to the farm of the company Vemas a.s. They have 750 sows to produce piglets here, which are then transferred for pre-fattening. About 16,000 pigs continue to be fed each year and the remaining 7,000 are sold for fattening to other farms. Since 2012, Ms Jiřina Štěpánková has been working on this farm as the director.'

        text: 'In recent years, the results of sow reproduction have improved. The innovated feeds for pregnant and lactating sows are largely responsible. “We currently achieve around 32 reared piglets per sow a year. I am also very satisfied with the work of the De Heus specialist, who visits us at least twice a month and is also on call, if necessary,” says Jiřina Štěpánková.'

        text: 'Jiřina really appreciates the flexibility and wide-ranging professional knowledge of their De Heus specialist. “He visits many farms not only in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, but also in other countries which I don’t have a chance to visit. He also helps me evaluate all the results in the form of tables and graphs. In addition, he provides us with an ultrasonic fat measurement service for sows, regularly twice a month. In practice, this means that we do not have thin or overweight sows and this is the key to a higher number of reared piglets per sow. Of course, this also increases the farm''s profit."'
